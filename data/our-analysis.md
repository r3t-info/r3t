**What is the main problem for the digital industry in Europe, according to you?**
 
The cultures and structures that are embedded in the established organisations and the ecosystem around them.
 
**Why?**
 
The structures, e.g. the existing value chains creates lock in effects where the end customer pays way too much money for limited services and values.
 
Most of the companies in the value chains delivers *steam engines* and the consultant firms shovel coal with *paid by the hour* business models.
 
This is a fascinating paradox, the “consulting by the hour” firms claims to sell digital transformation, while the majority of these firms work with 30 years old business models.

Complex problems cannot be solved by new technology alone.
