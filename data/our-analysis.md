***R3T:** What is the main problem for the digital industry in Europe, according to you?*

***R3T:** And why?*

**Jens Ohlsson**: The structures e.g. the existing value chains in the software industry creates lock in effects where the end customer pays way too much money for limited deliveries and values. 

As if the established software companies delivered steam engines and the consultant firms would shovel coal with “paid by the hour” revenue models… even though there are digital electrical motors in place!

This is a fascinating paradox, since the “consulting by the hour” firms claims to sell digital transformation, while the majority of these firms work with 30 years old business models.
